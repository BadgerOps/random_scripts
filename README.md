random scripts, duh. They're probably not useful for you. Or maybe they are? 

You don't want these scripts. I wrote them to make my life easier and they'll probably do nothing to your box, OR
they'll bork your box. You have been warned. Highly unlikely I'll accept pull requests unless of course they actually
make my life easier. <3
